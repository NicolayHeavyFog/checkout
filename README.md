E-commerce project for online-register to flight.

At the first glance it can image so as easy work, but, to be honest, the project has a big variable of scenarios. I needed to process a lot of requests with a lot of responses. Each response status needs its own activity. Long story short, work is enough.

For while, I have appearance so interesting task about taking seat map for flights. It was curious.

I used Vue 2 composition API, Pinia, and Vuetify. That is enough at the moment.
